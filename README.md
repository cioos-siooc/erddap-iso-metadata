# erddap-iso-metadata
A tool for querying an ERDDAP server and generating ISO19139 Metadata files with PyGeoMeta.  Other data sources may need to be layered in on top of the skeleton that ERDDAP can provide.  PyGeoMeta provides YAML based schemas and Jinja2 templates for transforming the metadata from YAML into ISO XML.
